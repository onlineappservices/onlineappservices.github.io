      <h4>
        These are some frequently asked questions about the services we offer!
      </h4>
      <h5>
        <strong> Will you write a review of my app on the app store? </strong>
          <br>
        <small> Unfortunately, at this time we do not provide service to allow customers to buy app reviews. </small>
      </h5>
      <h5>
        <strong> Do I really <em>need</em> my app tested? </strong>
          <br>
        <small> We believe that a developer can only improve the user experience so far. Once you become too familliar with your own piece of software,
        it's easy to overlook subtle things that you're just used to, but really break the seamless user experience. A fresh set of eyes and perspective
      can go a long way! </small>
      </h5>
      <h5>
        <strong> How can your service be so cheap?! </strong>
          <br>
        <small> We've refined the process we use to generate reports. For this reason, we're able to provide basic reports quite quickly. This is the reason
        for our tiered pricing scheme: the more detailed the report, the more time it takes us to complete! </small>
      </h5>
      <h5>
        <strong> How long does order delivery usually take? </strong>
          <br>
        <small> Depending on the volume and size of the jobs in our queue, we can finish jobs anywhere from within a few hours to a few days. Typically, <thead>
          largest of orders will take 5-7 days, while small orders can take between 2 hours and 3-4 days.
        </thead> </small>
