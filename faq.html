      <h4>
        These are some frequently asked questions about the services we offer!
      </h4>
      <h5>
        <strong> Will you write a review of my app on the app store? </strong>
          <br>
        <small> This is not the kind of service that we provide. It is against Apple's terms of service to purchase reviews on
        the app store. Besides, it's better for you in the long run to build a great product with a large userbase of satisfied customers
        than to spend your time geneating reviews. </small>
      </h5>
      <h5>
        <strong> Do I really <em>need</em> my app tested? </strong>
          <br>
        <small> We believe that a developer can only improve the user experience so far. Once you become too familliar with your own piece of software,
        it's easy to overlook subtle things that you're just used to, but really break the seamless user experience. A fresh set of eyes and perspective
        can go a long way! </small>
      </h5>
      <h5>
        <strong> What is your pricing model based on? </strong>
          <br>
        <small> We've refined the process we use to test your app, in order to get you the best value possible! Our basic report starts at just $10,
        and is a great starting place if you are new to developing applications. We'll get you set up with some information on where your software
        is heading and what you can do to improve! Our more advanced packages become more time consuming as we give a deeper evaluation, and this
        kind of insight is invaluable to developers (that's you!) who are looking to improve their software!</small>
      </h5>
      <h5>
        <strong> How long does order delivery usually take? </strong>
          <br>
        <small> Depending on the volume and size of the jobs in our queue, we can finish jobs anywhere from within a few hours to a few days. Typically, <thead>
          largest of orders will take 5-7 days, while small orders can take between 2 hours and 3-4 days. When an order for a report is opened with us,
          we'll establish a due date with you, along with a 100% guarantee for on-time delivery.
